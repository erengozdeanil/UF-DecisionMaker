# SYSTEMATIC INTEGRATION OF URBAN FARMING INTO URBAN METABOLISMS
# Waste As A Resource For Urban Food Production
Todayâ€™s cities are fed with natural resources and food coming from outside, and after these
resources are consumed the waste is sent back outside resulting in a linear process scheme.
Repurposing some waste flows within the city can potentially transform the linear metabolism of
cities to circular metabolism. By integrating urban farming into the cityscapes, a variety of
wastes can be repurposed, food can be grown on the farm, food miles can be decreased, the
psychological well-being of nearby inhabitants can be improved, and additional food supply
chain can be introduced. Due to the potential environmental and social benefits, urban farming
has, it is proposed to be utilised as an exchange hub of waste flows and food in this project. In
the quest of forming a network of urban farms which use waste as a resource and occupy
vacant spaces, there is a multitude of variables that complicate the decision-making process.
These variables include different types of urban farming systems, different urban waste flows,
characteristics of vacant spaces, distances between the waste flows and urban farms. This
complicated nature of the design problem calls for a decision making strategy.
Therefore this research aims to answer the following questions:
In which situations can different urban farming systems employ different urban waste
flows in order to promote the circularity of food production and resources in urban
contexts by augmenting the design process with decision support systems?
The objective of the research is to provide a decision making strategy for integrating urban
farming into urban waste flows by occupying vacant spaces within the urban context. Urban
farming systems which are included in the research are mushroom farms, vermicomposting,
raised beds, plant factories, aquaponics and hydroponics with different nutrient delivery
techniques such as water culture, nutrient film technique (NFT), media beds and aeroponics.
Urban waste flows that are in the scope of the research are food waste, coffee waste,
cellulose-based waste (paper, cardboard, woodchips), CO2, residual heat and rainwater. Vacant
spaces which are included in the research are rooftops, building facades, rooms in basements,
on ground floors or other floor levels. Aforementioned, vacant space characteristics include the
structural capacity of the spaces i.e. roofs tend to have lower load-bearing capacity compared to
ground floor levels. Other characteristics of vacant spaces are solar exposure and their
locations to comprehend the distances between the urban farms and their vicinity to waste
flows.
The final product of the thesis is a decision-making (DM) tool to support designers to choose
fitting urban farming systems to existing conditions such as vacant space, waste flows in the
vicinity and stakeholder goals. The DM tool will be tested on case studies to assess the
performance of the tool and will be altered if necessary. The outcome of the decision-making
tool will be a selection of urban farming systems however their dimensions or other design
characteristics will not be given in detail.
